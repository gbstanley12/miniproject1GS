## Display Your Own Stocks

You can easily customize this Python script to display the closing prices of your own stocks. Follow these steps to add your own stocks to the list of displayed charts:

1. Open the `stocks` list in the Python script (`main.py`):

   ```python
   stocks = ["MANU", "MSGS", "BATRA", "RCI", "CHDN"]

2. Change these ticker symbols to the stocks that you desire to view.

3. Save your changes in the script.

4. Run the script again, and it will generate charts for your specified stocks.

5. The generated charts will be saved in a folder named "Charts" in the same directory as the script. You can view and analyze these charts to track the closing prices of your chosen stocks.
